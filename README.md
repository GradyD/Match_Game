C++ Final Exam Project

Team ReadME
=============
This is so that everyone can easily view the code. If you are interested in actually writing the code outside of class let me know and I will show you how to setup so that you can add to the code.

Rules
======

1. Do not rename vars
2. Try to follow the format so that our code will flow
3. Do not remove code unless you replace it with a new/better method (commit stuff out)
4. Do not upload code that does not compile (commit stuff out)

Commits
========
When pushing code, please make you commit description clear as to what you edited/changed so other memebers can easily adjust.

Do not kill your code with commits but give enough so we can see what you have added.
